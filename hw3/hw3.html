                        <li>you should have a button for submitting the data and a button to clear the form</li>

            <h3>Part2</h3>
            <p>A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $250 per week, plus
                9% of their gross sales for the week.</p>
            <p>For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of merchandise in a week, will receives $250 <span
                    style="background-color: #fff060;"><strong>PLUS</strong></span> 9% of $5000, which will be a total
                of $700. You have been supplied with a list of the items that can be sold by each salesperson. The value
                of these items are as follows:</p>

            <p>Create a web page that might look similar to the layout shown in the image below.</p>
            <p>The page will contain a script that includes a<span class="Apple-converted-space">to the top of your
                    form&nbsp; a text box for the salesperson's name for the user to enter. When the user's mouse hovers
                    over this name field, <em><strong>use the jQuery UI tooltip coding</strong></em> to display the
                    message "<em><strong>Please make sure that the salesperson's name is spelled
                            correctly</strong></em>". See this site for more about the <a
                        href="http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/" class="external" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>jQuery UI tooltip</span></span></a>.
            </p>
            <p><span>The user will input the quantity of items sold, for each item</span>.
            </p>
            <p>You will use that input to calculate how much the salesperson sold and how much he/she will earn, and
                then output the results. <br><span style="background-color: #fff060;"><strong>TIP: </strong></span>Be
                sure to round the outputted results to 2 decimal places (money is not represented with more than 2
                decimals, right?). <br>Use input boxes to input the number sold for each of the items 1-4. <br>You
                should also check for valid numeric input (make sure the number of items sold is never negative, &lt; 0,
                as nobody sells negative number of items, right?)</p>
            <p>The results of total sold in dollars and the total money that will be received by the sale person should
                be right-justify (aligned to the right)</p>
            <p>Here is an image showing a possible display that is using tables, and form elements (labels, input boxes,
                buttons, etc.) and some tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The boxes for seller's name, and Item 1, Item 2, Item 3, Item 4 will be the boxes that the user will
                    type data</li>
                <li>All the boxes below Qty Sold and Total should be readonly as you will present the values via your
                    code - for example, the Qty Sold box beside the Item 1 should present the number typed by the user
                    for the quantity the seller sold of Item 1, then, below the Total, the box that is related to Item 1
                    will show the gross amount of that sale which, of course will be the multiplication of the quantity
                    sold of item 1 by the price of Item 1 (20.99), etc.</li>
                <li>In the box beside total earnings, you need to make sure that you first add all the values for each
                    of the Total boxes (for item 1, item 2, item 3, item 4), then you calculate the 9% of that value
                    and, finally, you add 250 to that result to give the total earnings of the seller!</li>
                <li>It is ok to use input type="text" for the seller's name but for the item 1, 2, 3, and 4, it will be
                    better if you use input type="number" or if you use input type="text" you will need to test if the
                    user typed a REAL number before doing ANY type of Math operation with that value!</li>
            </ul>

                there!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Write a program that will help an elementary school student learn multiplication.</li>
                <li>Use <strong>Math.random</strong> to produce two one-digit integers (<strong>NO DECIMALS</strong>)
                    from 0 to 9.</li>
                <li>With those two numbers, you should present a question such as: <em><strong>How much is X times
                            Y</strong><strong>?</strong></em> where <em><strong>X</strong></em> is one of the random
                    numbers and <em><strong>Y</strong></em> is the other random number</li>
                <li>The student then types the answer into an input box you will provide.</li>
                <li>Your program checks the student's answer.</li>
                <li>If it is correct, display the message "Very good!" in a text area or another part of the page, and
                    then shows a question to the user to see whether he/she wants to keep playing.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the user responds <strong>YES</strong> (click on a button that says YES), you will then
                            generate another question</li>
                        <li>If the user responds <strong>NO</strong> (click on a button that says NO), you will present
                            a message such as "<em><strong>Thanks for playing, see you next time</strong></em>" and you
                            <strong>will NOT present another question</strong>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If the answer to the multiplication question is wrong, display the message "<em><strong>No. Please
                            try again.</strong></em>" directly on the page in a textarea or another part of the page,
                    and let the student try the same question again repeatedly until the student finally gets it
                    right.<br><br></li>
